Welcome to my personal site!

As of 8/9/22, the site should have:
  I. About
    a. A little bit about me!
  II. Photography
    b. My photography work
  III. Coding Projects
    c. Showcase of projects I have worked on in past classes and some current/future ones!
  IV. Hyperlinks to my social media
  
Some future goals:
  I. "Post" and filter photos feature
    a. Allows me to post photos without having to hardcode it on github
    b. Filter photos through date, film/digital, film stock, camera model, etc
